# Commands & settings

**Note**: This file is specific to plugin development. Themes do not have commands or settings.

- Any user-facing commands should be added via `this.addCommand(...)`.
- If the plugin has configuration, provide a settings tab and sensible defaults.
- Persist settings using `this.loadData()` / `this.saveData()`.
- Use stable command IDs; avoid renaming once released.

## Version Considerations

When using newer API features (e.g., `SettingGroup` since API 1.11.0), you must set `minAppVersion: "1.11.0"` in your `manifest.json`.
