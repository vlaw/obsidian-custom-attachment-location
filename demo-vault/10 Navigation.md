Once attachments live in a folder per note, moving between the two by hand means scrolling the file explorer to a folder whose name you have to remember. Two commands do it for you.

## Custom Attachment Location: Go to attachment folder

Run it on a note and the file explorer reveals the folder that note's attachments are saved into.

The folder is worked out from your **Attachment folder path** pattern, not from a fixed folder name, so it follows whatever you configured — one folder beside every note, a folder per note, a folder per year.

Two cases the command has to answer for:

- **The folder does not exist yet.** A note with no attachments has no folder. Rather than creating one behind your back, the command shows a notice naming the path with a **Create** button. Click it and the folder is created and revealed; ignore it and nothing is written.
- **The pattern depends on the attachment.** If your **Attachment folder path** contains `{{prompt}}` or `{{originalAttachmentFileName}}`, the folder is decided per attachment, so the note has no single folder to go to. The command says so instead of guessing.

## Custom Attachment Location: Go to owning note

Run it on an attachment and the note that owns it opens.

This is not the first command run backwards. A pattern cannot be un-applied — `{{random}}` and `{{prompt}}` throw away the information you would need — so the owner is found from the **links** instead: the notes that reference the attachment.

- **One note references it.** That note opens.
- **Several do.** The **Note priorities** setting decides, exactly as it does when collecting (see [06 Settings](<./06 Settings.md>)). Put `.md` above `.excalidraw.md` and an image shared by both opens the markdown note.
- **The priority list names nobody** — it is empty, nothing matched, or several notes tie — you are asked which one, and told which of the three it was. Only the notes sharing the best rank are offered: the list has already ruled the others out, so picking one would open a note the plugin itself would never have chosen. When the list decides nothing, every referencing note is offered.

If the attachment sits in an **attachment unit folder** (see [06 Settings](<./06 Settings.md>)), the whole folder is consulted, not just the selected file. A saved web page's `_files` folder holds one linked `.html` and a pile of images nothing links to directly; without this they would all be ownerless.

## Try it

1. Open [01 Attachment folder location](<./01 Attachment folder location.md>) and paste an image into it — you supply the file.
2. Run **Custom Attachment Location: Go to attachment folder**. The file explorer highlights `assets/01 Attachment folder location/`.
3. Click the pasted image to open it, then run **Custom Attachment Location: Go to owning note**. You are back in the note.
4. Right-click either file in the file explorer — both commands are on the context menu too.
