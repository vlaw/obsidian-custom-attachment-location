# Attachment folder location

The headline feature: **you** decide the folder each attachment is saved into, per note, using tokens. This vault is set to the plugin's default pattern:

```text
./assets/{{noteFileName}}
```

A fresh install does not start here. It follows Obsidian's own attachment setting, so installing the plugin changes nothing until you turn off **Follow Obsidian attachment location** - see **Let Obsidian decide** below. This vault has already turned it off, so that the patterns on this page take effect.

The `./` means "relative to the folder of the note you are editing", and `{{noteFileName}}` expands to the current note's name. So an attachment pasted here goes into a folder named after this note.

## Try it

1. Click somewhere in this note to put the cursor here.
2. Paste an image from your clipboard (or drag an image file into the editor). You supply the file - the demo cannot paste for you.
3. Look in the File Explorer: a folder like `assets/01 Attachment folder location/` now holds the file, and the inserted link points at it.

No image to hand? You can ask the plugin where a paste **would** go without pasting anything. The button calls the same function Obsidian calls when you paste, so the answer is the real one:

```code-button
---
caption: Where would a pasted image go?
---
await require('/demoSetup.ts').previewAttachmentPath(app);
```

Manual equivalent: paste an image and look at where it landed. Try it from a different note and the answer changes - that is `{{noteFileName}}` at work.

Paste another image into [02 Attachment file naming](<./02 Attachment file naming.md>) and notice it lands in a *different* per-note folder. That is `{{noteFileName}}` at work.

## Change the location

Open **Settings -> Community plugins -> Custom Attachment Location** and edit **Location for new attachments** (`attachmentFolderPath`). For example:

- `assets`
  - one shared folder (an absolute, vault-root path, because there is no leading `./`).
- `./attachments`
  - a folder next to each note.
- `./assets/{{noteFileName}}/{{date:{momentJsFormat:'YYYY'}}}`
  - per-note, then split by year.

Each is a button, since token patterns are exactly the kind of string that is easy to mistype. Press one, then ask where a paste would go:

```code-button
---
caption: One shared folder (`assets`)
---
await require('/demoSetup.ts').changeSettings(app, { attachmentFolderPath: 'assets' });
```

```code-button
---
caption: A folder next to each note (`./attachments`)
---
await require('/demoSetup.ts').changeSettings(app, { attachmentFolderPath: './attachments' });
```

```code-button
---
caption: Per-note, then split by year
---
await require('/demoSetup.ts').changeSettings(app, { attachmentFolderPath: './assets/{{noteFileName}}/{{date:{momentJsFormat:\'YYYY\'}}}' });
```

```code-button
---
caption: Where would a pasted image go now?
---
await require('/demoSetup.ts').previewAttachmentPath(app);
```

```code-button
---
caption: Restore this vault's default patterns
---
await require('/demoSetup.ts').restoreDefaultPatterns(app);
```

Manual equivalent for all of them: edit **Location for new attachments** in **Settings -> Community plugins -> Custom Attachment Location**.

## Let Obsidian decide

Obsidian has a folder setting of its own: **Settings -> Files and links -> Default location for new attachments**. While this plugin uses its own pattern, that setting is not in effect, and Obsidian's settings page says so - the row reads *Controlled by Custom Attachment Location*, with a button that opens this plugin's settings.

Turn on **Follow Obsidian attachment location** (`shouldFollowObsidianAttachmentLocation`) - it is on in a fresh install - and it is the other way round: new attachments go wherever Obsidian's own setting says, Obsidian's settings page shows its own control again, and **Location for new attachments** is hidden and not used. The pattern you had is kept, so turning the mode off brings it back. Only the folder follows Obsidian - the file-name settings in [02 Attachment file naming](<./02 Attachment file naming.md>) still apply.

Each of Obsidian's four options lands where Obsidian itself puts it:

| Obsidian's option | Where an attachment for this note goes |
| --- | --- |
| Vault folder | the vault root |
| In the folder specified below | that folder, e.g. `assets` |
| Same folder as current file | this note's folder |
| In subfolder under current folder | a subfolder of this note's folder, e.g. `attachments` |

**Collect attachments** follows it too, unless you gave collecting a folder of its own (see [05 Collect attachments](<./05 Collect attachments.md>)).

```code-button
---
caption: Follow Obsidian's own setting
---
await require('/demoSetup.ts').changeSettings(app, { shouldFollowObsidianAttachmentLocation: true });
```

```code-button
---
caption: Where would a paste go, following Obsidian?
---
await require('/demoSetup.ts').previewAttachmentPath(app);
```

To hand the folder back to this plugin's pattern, press **Restore this vault's default patterns** above - it turns the mode off too.

Manual equivalent: toggle **Follow Obsidian attachment location** in **Settings -> Community plugins -> Custom Attachment Location**, then change **Default location for new attachments** in **Settings -> Files and links**.

See [03 Tokens and patterns](<./03 Tokens and patterns.md>) for the full token list.
