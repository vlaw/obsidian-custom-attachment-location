# Start here

Welcome to the [Custom Attachment Location](https://github.com/mnaoumov/obsidian-custom-attachment-location/) demo vault. When you paste or drag a file into a note, Obsidian normally drops it into one shared attachment folder with a generic name. **Custom Attachment Location** lets you decide *where* each attachment is stored and *how* it is named, using tokens like `${noteFileName}`, `${date:{momentJsFormat:'YYYYMMDD'}}`, and many more.

**How to try it:** open [01 Attachment folder location](<./01 Attachment folder location.md>) and paste an image into it. With this vault's settings, the file lands in a per-note folder such as `assets/01 Attachment folder location/` instead of one global pile. A fresh install of the plugin changes nothing about where attachments land: it follows Obsidian's own attachment setting until you pick a pattern, and this vault has picked one. You supply the pasted or dragged file - the plugin decides where it goes and what it is called.

Most of this vault is driven by you supplying a file, so there is little to click. The one exception is [08 Delete unused attachments](<./08 Delete unused attachments.md>), which carries a **code button** — a captioned rectangle that runs the code it contains when you click it, showing the result underneath, with a `</>` toggle beside it that reveals the source. It is powered by [`CodeScript Toolkit`](https://github.com/mnaoumov/obsidian-codescript-toolkit/), which this vault installs for you on first open. The note spells out the manual equivalent too, so you never strictly need it.
