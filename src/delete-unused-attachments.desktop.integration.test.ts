/*
 * End-to-end coverage for issue #23 (the delete half): the "Delete unused attachments in current note"
 * command / context-menu item trashes attachments in a note's attachment folder that the note no longer
 * references, while protecting attachments that are still referenced by the note OR by another note.
 *
 * The data-destructive path is driven through the REAL confirmation modal (the OK button is clicked in
 * the live DOM), not stubbed. Scenario, in the note `note-<stamp>`'s attachment folder
 * `assets/note-<stamp>/`:
 *   - `ref-<stamp>.png`    -> embedded in the note                 -> MUST survive;
 *   - `orphan-<stamp>.png` -> referenced by no note                -> MUST be trashed;
 *   - `shared-<stamp>.png` -> referenced only by `other-<stamp>.md` -> MUST survive (shared attachment).
 *
 * Desktop-only: the plugin is cross-platform (`isDesktopOnly: false`), but this run has no Android
 * emulator provisioned, and the delete flow is platform-agnostic vault/trash + modal DOM logic with no
 * version-sensitive Obsidian internals. The sibling
 * `collect-attachments-exclusion.desktop.integration.test.ts` is desktop-only for the same reason.
