/*
 * Coverage for issue #27 (a library-side fix consumed via obsidian-dev-utils 88.2.0): a canvas text node
 * holding a markdown TABLE cell with a sized, table-escaped embed `![[img.png\|500]]` must keep the
 * `\|500` escaping (embed size) when the canvas rewrite retargets the embed. Pre-88.2.0 the rewrite
 * emitted an UNescaped `|500`, breaking the surrounding table. The fix lives in obsidian-dev-utils
 * `applyCanvasChanges`, which restores the escaping when the original reference used `\|`.
 *
 * NOT COVERED END TO END — the behavioral rewrite cannot be driven to completion in the hidden-mode
 * headless harness. Confirmed empirically against the harness-owned real Obsidian:
 *   - Renaming the IMAGE directly does not reach canvas text-node embeds (canvases are not in the
 *     backlink cache; the obsidian-dev-utils rename handler invokes `getCanvasReferences` only when
 *     the RENAMED file is itself a canvas).
 *   - Moving the CANVAS relocates FILE-node attachments (the issue-#22 suite passes) but NOT a
 *     TEXT-node embed's attachment.
 *   - "Collect attachments in current note" over the canvas (canvas confirmed as the active file,
 *     command executed) does NOT relocate/rewrite the embed — for BOTH a plain `![[img.png]]` and
 *     the table-escaped `![[img.png\|500]]`. Root cause: `getCanvasReferences` discovers canvas
 *     FILE-node references headlessly (proven by the issue-#22 suite) but NOT TEXT-node embeds,
 *     because canvas text-node markdown parsing (`computeMetadataAsync`) does not populate in the
 *     hidden-mode harness. With no text-node reference discovered, no flow reaches
 *     `applyCanvasChanges` for a text embed, so the escaping fix cannot be observed here.
 *
 * The fix IS covered upstream by a unit test in obsidian-dev-utils (`file-change.test.ts`: a
 * round-trip of a table-escaped sized embed `![[old.png\|500]]` -> `![[new.png\|500]]`). This suite
 * is therefore recorded as a documented, skipped behavioral test with the assertions it WOULD run
 * plus the manual repro recipe below, rather than silently omitted.
 *
 * MANUAL REPRO (real Obsidian, GUI):
 *   1. Install + enable Custom Attachment Location; set "Location for new attachments" to a relative
 *      shared folder (e.g. `./assets`), "Should handle renames" ON.
 *   2. Create `img.png` and a canvas containing a TEXT card with a markdown table whose cell is
 *      `| ![[img.png\|500]] |`. Save.
 *   3. Rename `img.png` -> `renamed.png` (or run "Collect attachments in current note" on the canvas).
 *   4. Open the canvas text card in edit mode: the cell must read `![[renamed.png\|500]]` (backslash
 *      before the pipe preserved, table intact) — NOT `![[renamed.png|500]]` (which breaks the table).
