/**
 * @file
 *
 * Publishes which folders the user has designated as attachment units, and reads that answer back.
 *
 * The designation is this plugin's setting, but it is not only this plugin's business. Advanced Rename
 * and Delete Handler owns the delete interception from 12.0.0, and it has to keep a designated folder
 * whole when it rescues an attachment out of a deleted note's area (issue #70) — while deliberately
 * resolving attachment policy without knowing which plugin supplies it.
 *
 * So the designation rides the seam that already carries exactly that kind of answer: the `extended`
 * member this plugin hangs off the patched `Vault.getAvailablePathForAttachments`. A missing member
 * means no attachment-location plugin published one, which is the same "nobody owns this policy"
 * answer `extended` itself gives.
 *
 * Reading it back here rather than consulting the settings directly is the point: the collecting
 * commands and the other plugin then decide from ONE published answer. Two plugins deciding separately
 * what a single attachment is would leave a folder kept whole by one and torn apart by the other,
 * which is the failure `obsidian-dev-utils`' own attachment-unit-folder module exists to prevent.
