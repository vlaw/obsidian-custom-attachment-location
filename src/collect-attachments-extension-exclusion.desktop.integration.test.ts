/*
 * End-to-end coverage for issue #80: `excludeExtensionsFromMultipleNotesCheck` must make the
 * "Collect attachments in current note" command skip the multiple-notes check entirely for attachments
 * whose file type the user has declared deliberately shared.
 *
 * It is the twin of `collect-attachments-exclusion.desktop.integration.test.ts`, which proves the other
 * axis (issue #33, the NOTE paths that do not count as a second referrer). The two are separate files
 * because the thing being staged differs: there a second referring note, here a second referring note
 * that is perfectly ordinary and must stay counted for every attachment but the listed one.
 *
 * Scenario: an attachment referenced by TWO ordinary notes, with the multiple-notes mode set to `Skip`:
 *   - control (empty list) -> two backlinks -> Skip -> the attachment is NOT collected;
 *   - fix (list the attachment's extension) -> the check never runs -> the attachment IS collected.
 *
 * The control phase is the load-bearing half. Without it the fix phase would pass just as well against a
 * build that had stopped running the multiple-notes check at all.
