 * note owns a shared attachment must list only the notes tying for the HIGHEST rank. A note the
 * priority list deliberately ranked below them cannot resolve the ambiguity, so listing it is noise -
 * the reporter's words were "allows user to only see the relevant notes to solve the ambiguity".
 *
 * The reporter's shape is staged for real: a note that ends in `.md` but is demoted by a longer entry,
 * beside two plain notes that tie. Longest-match is what does the demoting, so this also proves the
 * rank comes from the configured list rather than from the file extension.
