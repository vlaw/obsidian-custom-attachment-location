 * it. The reporter's words were "allows user to identify the real reason an image is not moving".
 *
 * Two of the three reasons are staged for real, because they are the two a user can actually cause:
 * an empty priority list (the default), and a tie between notes that match it equally well. The
 * third, "nothing matched", differs only in which string is picked and is covered by the unit tests.
