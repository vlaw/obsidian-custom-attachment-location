/*
 * End-to-end coverage for the second half of issue #59: an attachment another plugin writes
 * straight into the vault must be moved and renamed per the configured templates, once the opt-in
 * setting is on — and left exactly where it was written when the setting is off.
 *
 * The foreign write is reproduced the way Media Extended actually does it: compose a path of your own
 * and call `vault.createBinary`, never `app.saveAttachment`. That is precisely why the plugin's normal
 * naming pipeline (and `Attachment rename mode: All` with it) cannot see the file at all.
 *
 * Desktop-only: no Android emulator is available in this environment. The behavior is cross-platform,
 * so renaming this file to `*.cross-platform.integration.test.ts` lifts it to Android once one exists.
