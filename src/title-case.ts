 * Normalizes a human-typed name: collapses its whitespace and title-cases it while leaving acronyms

 *
 * Requested against `{{prompt}}` (issue #59), where the value is typed by hand and therefore arrives
 * with whatever spacing and casing the typing produced. Invalid characters are NOT handled here — the
 * plugin already replaces those through the `specialCharacters` / `specialCharactersReplacement`
 * settings, and a second, differently-configured idea of a valid character is exactly the kind of
 * duplication that drifts.
 *
 * The rules match Advanced Note Composer's `normalizeTypedFolderName`, which is where the reporter met
 * them. Worth lifting into `obsidian-dev-utils` once both plugins can be released together.
