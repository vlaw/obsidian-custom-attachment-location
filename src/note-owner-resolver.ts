/**
 * @file
 *
 * Answers "which note owns this attachment?".
 *
 * The attachment folder path is a template, so it cannot be run backwards: `${prompt}` and `${random}`
 * throw away the very value the folder name was built from, and nothing stops two notes resolving to
 * the same folder. The only reliable inverse is the link graph, ranked by the note-priority list the
 * user has already configured for exactly this question.
 *
 * The unit-folder widening matters more than it looks. A folder that travels as one unit — a saved
 * web page's `_files`, an `.excalidraw` sidecar tree — usually has a single linked entry point and a
 * pile of unlinked members next to it. Asking only for the selected file's own backlinks would leave
 * every one of those members ownerless, so the whole unit is consulted instead.
