/*
 * End-to-end coverage for issue #72 (G97): `Delete unused attachments in entire vault` judges a
 * designated attachment unit folder as ONE attachment.
 *
 * Two units are staged in the same sweep, because each one alone would pass a test the other fails:
 *
 * - `page_files` is the self-referencing unit the issue is about. A `.excalidraw.md` inside it embeds
 *   its sibling image, and Obsidian really does index that (it is a `.md`), so under the per-file rule
 *   the image carries a backlink forever and the unit is immortal. Only a rule that discounts links
 *   from INSIDE the unit can reach it.
 * - `kept_files` is the other half of the same idea: the note embeds one member, so the whole folder
 *   stays — including a sibling nothing references, which the per-file rule would have trashed. A unit
 *   that travels as one attachment dies as one too.
 *
 * `.excalidraw.md` is load-bearing rather than decorative: `treatAsAttachmentExtensions` keeps
 * `isNoteEx` false for it, so it is an attachment that nonetheless produces real backlinks. A plain
 * `.md` would instead trip the guard that spares any unit holding a real note.

 * Under the transport's ~30s per-closure cap, not at it.
