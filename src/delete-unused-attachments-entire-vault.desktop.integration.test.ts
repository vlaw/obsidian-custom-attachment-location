 * End-to-end coverage for issue #64 (G97): `Delete unused attachments` over the WHOLE vault, not just
 * the current note.
 *
 * The scenario is the one that makes the vault-wide scope different from running the per-note command
 * on whichever note happens to be open: the orphan sits in a folder belonging to a note that is NOT
 * active, so only a sweep that reads every note can find it. A second attachment, still embedded, is
 * staged alongside it and must survive -- a sweep that deleted both would "pass" a test that only
 * looked for the orphan being gone.

/*
 * THREE of these run in sequence inside a single `evalInObsidian` callback, so their sum has to fit the
 * test's own 180s budget with room to spare. Sized generously: the trash step runs on the plugin's
 * internal queue behind whatever else is in flight, and cutting it too fine just converts a slow-but-
 * correct pass into "the orphan was never trashed".
 */
/*
 * Under the transport's ~30s per-closure cap, not at it.
 * Three waits and a settle share this one budget, so at 20_000 apiece the closure declared 61s.
 * The eval is killed at the cap first and reported as a bare transport timeout.
 * That names the harness rather than the wait that overran.
 * The sweep runs over a small temp vault, so each step lands in well under a second.
 * The constant feeds nothing but closure input, so no Node-side wait sees the change.
