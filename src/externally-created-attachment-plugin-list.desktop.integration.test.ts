/*
 * End-to-end coverage for issue #77: the rename of an attachment another plugin created can be scoped to
 * a named set of plugins, in either polarity.
 *
 * The load-bearing claim under test is the ATTRIBUTION, and it is the one thing a unit test cannot fully
 * settle: Obsidian evaluates a community plugin's `main.js` with `//# sourceURL=plugin:<id>`, so a write
 * made from that code carries the id on its call stack. This suite reproduces that evaluation exactly —
 * the same `//# sourceURL=plugin:<id>` on a function compiled inside the running Obsidian — and drives a
 * real `vault.createBinary` through it, so a real Obsidian is what confirms the mechanism rather than a
 * fixture string.
 *
 * A fabricated id is used deliberately: no third-party plugin has to be installed for the attribution to
 * be exercised, and the assertion cannot silently pass because some real plugin happened to be present.
 *
 * Desktop-only: no Android emulator is available in this environment. The behavior is cross-platform, so
 * renaming this file to `*.cross-platform.integration.test.ts` lifts it to Android once one exists.
