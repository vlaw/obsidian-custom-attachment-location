/*
 * Desktop coverage for how the two per-note commands answer a file listed in `treatAsAttachmentExtensions`
 * (default `['.excalidraw.md']`), and why they answer it DIFFERENTLY.
 *
 *   - `Delete unused attachments in current note` is refused on such a file, and its sweep never scans one
 *     as a note. A drawing is an attachment of the note that embeds it, and scanning it as a note would judge
 *     every file in the folder its path resolves to as if the drawing owned them — candidates to TRASH. The
 *     images a drawing shows are safe regardless: they are backlinks, which the metadata cache carries,
 *     compressed or not (`delete-unused-attachments-drawing.desktop.integration.test.ts`).
 *   - `Collect attachments in current note` is still OFFERED on it. Issues #57 and #75 both ship collecting
 *     FROM a drawing as their defining scenario (`note-priority.desktop.integration.test.ts`,
 *     `collect-higher-priority-notes.desktop.integration.test.ts`), so the collect-side skip that Consistent
 *     Attachments and Links, the plugin this collector is forked from, applies is deliberately not ported. This half guards
 *     against a later port quietly taking that entry point away again.
 *
 * Each question is asked through `checkCallback(true)` — the availability probe Obsidian itself uses before
 * listing a command, so nothing runs and nothing moves — and in TWO phases. The control phase makes the
 * drawing an ordinary note, where both commands are offered; the fix phase restores the default. Without the
 * control a refusal would pass whenever the command was missing altogether.
 *
 * `treatAsAttachmentExtensions` belongs to Advanced Rename and Delete Handler since 12.0.0 and this plugin
 * asks `isTreatedAsAttachment(path)` rather than reading the array, so what each phase swaps is a stub
 * parked on the read-back component's live `apiRef`, which is the reason the other plugin does not have to be
 * reconfigured to run this.
 *
 * Desktop-only (the file name alone picks the project). The behavior itself is platform-agnostic.
