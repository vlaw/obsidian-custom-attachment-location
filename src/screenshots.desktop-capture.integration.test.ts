/**
 * @file
 *
 * Produces the desktop screenshots the community-store listing needs,
 * driving a staged vault in a real Obsidian and writing
 * `images/screenshots/screenshot-desktop-N.png`.
 *
 * FIVE shots of the problem the README opens with: attachments that pile up in
 * one folder under names that say nothing, and then get left behind when the
 * note moves. Shot 1 is that pile, taken with the plugin DISABLED so it is the
 * reader's own vault rather than a caricature; shots 2 to 5 are the plugin
 * answering it.
 *
 * Every attachment here is saved the way Obsidian saves a pasted one: through
 * `app.saveAttachment`, the sink Obsidian's own paste handler calls and the one
 * the plugin patches. Nothing is written to a path this suite chose — the frames
 * show where the file actually landed, under the name it actually got.
