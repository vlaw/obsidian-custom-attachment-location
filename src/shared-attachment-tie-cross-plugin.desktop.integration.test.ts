/*
 * The acceptance run for issue #71, with BOTH real plugins on one live vault.
 *
 * <https://github.com/mnaoumov/obsidian-custom-attachment-location/issues/71>: deleting a folder whose
 * attachment several surviving notes still reference used to stall silently — the folder holding the
 * attachment simply stayed. The request had two halves: consult the note-priority list before giving up, and,
 * when the top rank is TIED, name the tied notes and ask rather than stall.
 *
 * Both halves live in Advanced Rename and Delete Handler, which owns deletion interception since 12.0.0, and
 * both shipped in its 1.3.0. So there is no code in this repo to test — and that is exactly why this file
 * exists rather than being unnecessary.
 *
 * The handler's own suite stages the tie on Obsidian's BUILT-IN attachment location, with this plugin never
 * installed. The reporter runs this plugin. So the tie had never once executed against the patched
 * `Vault.getAvailablePathForAttachments` this plugin installs, which is the seam a reported defect hides in:
 * the dialog resolves to a note, and where that note's attachments actually live is this plugin's answer, not
 * Obsidian's.
 *
 * This suite removes that assumption. The handler's RELEASED build is in the vault and enabled, this plugin's
 * own `./assets` policy is what decides the destination, the tie is genuine — both survivors share the best
 * rank in a non-empty priority list — and the deletion is the real one. Sibling of
 * `attachment-unit-folder-rescue-cross-plugin.desktop.integration.test.ts`, which does the same for issue #70.
 *
 * Desktop-only for the same reason as every other suite here: this is where the vault runs.

 *
 * The pin is also what makes this suite falsifiable, and that was RUN rather than reasoned about. Pointed at
 * 1.2.0 — the last release before the dialog — it reproduces issue #71 instead of passing: `askWhoAdopts`
 * does not exist there, so the tie resolves to "leave it in place" and no dialog is ever raised. The run
 * dies on this file's own wait, naming the defect: `the ambiguity dialog never opened, so the tie was
 * settled without asking`. Since the seed carries the pin for every suite, repeating that means pointing the
 * seed at 1.2.0 for one run — which still satisfies the dependency, because 1.2.0 already publishes contract
