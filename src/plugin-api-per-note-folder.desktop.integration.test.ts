/*
 * End-to-end coverage for the published per-note read (`CustomAttachmentLocationApi.getAttachmentFolderPath`).
 *
 * The defect it replaces is not a crash, it is a wrong answer that looks right. This plugin patches
 * `Vault.getConfig('attachmentFolderPath')`, and that patch answers with the OPEN note's folder — the value is
 * computed once in `handleFileOpen` and held in a single field. A consumer auditing a vault note by note gets
 * the active note's folder for every one of them, silently.
 *
 * So the shape staged here is exactly that: two notes whose configured folders differ, with only the FIRST of
 * them open. A single run reads three things — the patched `getConfig`, the API asked about the open note, and
 * the API asked about the one that is not open. The patch must answer with the open note's folder for the
 * vault, and the API must answer with each note's own. Without the second reading, a read that simply returned
 * the same field would pass.
 *
 * The same staging then drives the acting member, `collectAttachments`: the open note's embedded image is
 * collected through the registry handle, and is read at the proper path the moment the promise settles — which
 * is what a consumer sequencing on the collect relies on, and what a promise that settled on queueing would fail.
