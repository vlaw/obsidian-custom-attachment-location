/**
 * Applies the plugin's folder and file-name templates to attachments OTHER plugins create.
 *
 * The plugin's own naming pipeline hangs off `app.saveAttachment`. A plugin that composes a path itself
 * and writes it with `vault.createBinary` never reaches that pipeline — Media Extended's screenshots are
 * the reported case (issue #59): it asks `fileManager.getAvailablePathForAttachment` for a throwaway path
 * only to strip the file name back off and keep the folder, then invents its own name. Not even
 * `Attachment rename mode: All` helps, because that switch lives inside `saveAttachment` too.
 *
 * So the only place left to catch such a file is after it exists. This mirrors what the *Paste image
 * rename* plugin does, and the catch itself stays GENERAL — nothing here is keyed to any one plugin.
 *
 * WHICH foreign writes are taken is the user's choice, though (issue #77): all of them, only a named set,
 * or all but a named set. That needs the creating plugin identified, which `vault.on('create')` cannot do —
 * `WriteAttributionPatchComponent` records it at the write instead, and this handler reads it back out of
 * {@link foreignWriteRegistry}.
 *
 * Off by default: it reacts to writes the plugin did not make, so it must never change behavior on
 * upgrade.

   * folder again, so the link came out as `./assets/<note>/assets/<note>/<file>`.
