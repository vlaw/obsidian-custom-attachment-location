/*
 * End-to-end coverage for issue #69: an attachment unit folder travels whole, so the folder it
 * was carried OUT of is the one left empty — and, with a deleting `emptyFolderBehavior`, the one that
 * must be swept.
 *
 * The bug was invisible from the moved side: the collect recorded the linked file's own parent as the
 * vacated folder, but that parent rides along inside the tree. Sweeping it hit a path that no longer
 * existed and silently did nothing, while the real parent — holding nothing but the unit folder that
 * just left — survived. So the staged source folder holds the unit folder and NOTHING else: it is
 * exactly the "last item moved out" the reporter described.
