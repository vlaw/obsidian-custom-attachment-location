 * "see the notes of higher priority that are referencing the image", so a notice must name them.
 *
 * The reporter's shape is staged for real: an image embedded in a drawing and in a plain note, with
 * the plain note ranked above it. The command runs on the DRAWING - the outranked note - which is the
 * only case that reports. Running it on the winner stays silent, which is issue #73's rule.
