/*
 * End-to-end coverage for issue #78: `collectedAttachmentFolderPath` must give the
 * `Collect attachments` commands a destination of their own, leaving the one that governs NEWLY
 * inserted attachments alone.
 *
 * The reporter's own workflow is what is staged: a shared `_Attachments` folder while a note is
 * being worked on, and a portable `<note>.assets` folder beside the note once it is collected for
 * export. Two phases over the same shape:
 *   - control (the setting empty) -> collecting uses the new-attachment location, as it always did;
 *   - fix (the setting filled in) -> collecting uses it instead.
 * Both phases also resolve where a NEW attachment would land, which is what proves the two
 * destinations are really decoupled rather than merely both changed.
