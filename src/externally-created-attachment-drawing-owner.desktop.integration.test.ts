/*
 * Issue #65 asks for a paste into an Excalidraw drawing to spawn the `${prompt}` box. This test pins
 * the boundary that answers it: `renameAttachmentsCreatedByOtherPluginsMode` -- the opt-in added for
 * issue #59 -- deliberately does NOTHING when the file in front of the user is one the user has listed
 * in `treatAsAttachmentExtensions`, which by default is exactly `.excalidraw.md`.
 *
 * That is not an oversight to be fixed by widening the gate. Excalidraw ships `compress: true`, so a
 * drawing's reference to a pasted image lives inside a `compressed-json` block: Obsidian never indexes
 * it, and neither `fileManager.renameFile` nor this plugin can rewrite it. Renaming such an image would
 * leave the drawing pointing at a path that no longer exists, silently. The handler declining is the
 * safe answer, and this test exists so a later change cannot quietly turn it into an unsafe one.
 *
 * Excalidraw itself is NOT installed here, and does not need to be: the gate under test is the plugin's
 * own `treatAsAttachmentExtensions` / `isNoteEx` pair, reached with a plain `.excalidraw.md` file open.
