/**
 * @file
 *
 * Produces the mobile screenshots the community-store listing needs,
 * driving a staged vault in Obsidian Mobile on a real Android emulator and
 * writing `images/screenshots/screenshot-mobile-N.png`.
 *
 * FIVE shots of the problem the README opens with: attachments that pile up in
 * one folder under names that say nothing, and then get left behind when the
 * note moves. Shot 1 is that pile, taken with the plugin DISABLED so it is the
 * reader's own vault rather than a caricature; shots 2 to 5 are the plugin
 * answering it.
 *
 * Every attachment here is saved the way Obsidian saves a pasted one: through
 * `app.saveAttachment`, the sink Obsidian's own paste handler calls and the one
 * the plugin patches. Nothing is written to a path this suite chose — the frames
 * show where the file actually landed, under the name it actually got.
 *
 * Worth taking on a phone rather than reusing the desktop set: a phone is where
 * pasted screenshots pile up fastest and where the file tree is a drawer the
 * reader rarely opens, so seeing the arrangement on a phone screen is the point.
 * The tree lives in that drawer here, which is why every frame opens it.
 *
 * There is no mobile equivalent of the desktop viewport override, so the capture
 * is always the device's own framebuffer — a dedicated `obsidian_screenshots`
 * AVD built at exactly 900x1600, so the frame already IS the store's size.
