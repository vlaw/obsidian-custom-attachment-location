 * notes owns an attachment, so collecting no longer has to fall back to
 * `collectAttachmentUsedByMultipleNotesMode`.
 *
 * The reporter's scenario, staged literally: one image embedded by BOTH a plain markdown note and an
 * Excalidraw note. The control phase proves the attachment is left where it is without the setting —
 * which is the behavior being replaced — and the fix phase proves it lands in the higher-priority
 * note's folder.
 *
 * Note the fix phase deliberately runs the command on the LOSING note: priority decides ownership,
 * not whichever note you happened to have open. That is the behavior worth pinning down, because it
 * is the surprising half of the feature.
