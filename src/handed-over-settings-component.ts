/**
 * @file
 *
 * Reads back the settings this plugin handed to Advanced Rename and Delete Handler in 12.0.0.
 *
 * Handing the rename/delete HANDLER over did not stop this plugin needing the VALUES. Collect attachments
 * cleans up folders it empties, Go to owning note ranks the notes referencing an attachment, `isNoteEx`
 * decides what counts as a note, and every command checks whether a path is ignored — none of which is a
 * rename or a delete. Rather than keep private copies of settings another plugin now owns, this plugin asks
 * for them.
 *
 * Reads are synchronous and uncached. `PluginApiRef.value` is maintained by the registry, so reading it is a
 * field access rather than a lookup, and asking on every call means there is no staleness to invalidate when
 * the user edits a setting in the other plugin's tab. Uncached also sidesteps the revoked-handle trap: the
 * handle is never stored, so a provider that unloads simply makes the next read fall back.
