/*
 * End-to-end coverage for T847 (G97): the vault-wide sweep reaching an attachment folder whose owning note
 * no longer exists.
 *
 * The scenario is the one no note-driven scan can reach. An attachment folder is visited only through the
 * note that resolves to it, so when that note is gone -- deleted by a sync client, which fires no event this
 * plugin can see -- nothing in the vault points at the folder and the sweep walks straight past it.
 *
 * Both halves run in ONE Obsidian session, because the first half is the regression guard for the second:
 * with the mode off the file must SURVIVE the sweep, and only after the mode is turned on must the very same
 * file be found. A test that only asserted the second half would pass just as well against a sweep that
 * deleted everything it saw.
