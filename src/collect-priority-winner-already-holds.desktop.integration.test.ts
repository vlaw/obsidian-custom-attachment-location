 * The `multiple notes` box was reporting an ambiguity the priority list had already settled.
 *
 * The staged note embeds two images: one already sitting in the note's own attachment folder and
 * shared with a lower-priority note, and one loose at the vault root that only this note references.
 * The loose image moving is the proof the pass ran to completion - under the reported bug the mode is
 * `Cancel`, so the box would abort the whole run and the loose image would never move at all.
