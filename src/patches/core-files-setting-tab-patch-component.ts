/**
 * @file
 *
 * Makes Obsidian's own *Files and links* page say who decides where new attachments go.
 *
 * While this plugin places attachments by its own template, Obsidian's *Default location for new attachments*
 * still shows the value the user stored there — a value that is not in effect. Two settings pages then disagree
 * about who decides. This replaces that row with one saying the plugin controls it, with a button to the
 * plugin's own setting. While the plugin follows Obsidian's location instead, Obsidian's value really is in
 * effect, so the page is left exactly as it is.
 *
 * This is the only patch here on a CORE SETTINGS TAB rather than an API, and the tab is Obsidian-internal with
 * no public contract. So it is written to fail closed: a missing tab, a missing method, no matching row, or a
 * throw anywhere in the rewrite all hand Obsidian its own definitions back untouched. A cosmetic honesty fix
 * must never be able to break Obsidian's settings.
 *
 * The rows are found by the config key their `render` writes, `attachmentFolderPath`, not by their names: the
 * names are localized, and the key is persisted in every vault's `app.json`, so it survives both translation
 * and minification.
